<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flocculants and Coagulants for Water Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Type</li><li>Organic Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flocculants and coagulants are chemicals used in the water treatment industry to remove impurities from water. Inorganic flocculants and coagulants are derived from minerals and typically include alum, ferric chloride, and polyaluminum chloride. These chemicals neutralize the charge of particles, allowing them to clump together and be easily removed. Organic flocculants and coagulants are made from polymers and are more effective in treating organic and colloidal impurities. They work by absorbing impurities and forming larger particles, making them easier to separate from the water.</p></p>
