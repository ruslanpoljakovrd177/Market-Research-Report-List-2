<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PWR</li><li>BWR</li><li>PHWR</li><li>GCR</li><li>LWGR</li><li>FBR</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The nuclear reactor pressure vessel market consists of various types of reactors: Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), Boiling Water Reactor (BWR), Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR), Gas-Cooled Reactor (GCR), Light Water Graphite Reactor (LWGR), and Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR). PWR uses water to cool the nuclear fuel and produce steam, which drives a turbine. BWR also uses water as both a coolant and as a steam generator. PHWR uses heavy water as a moderator and coolant. GCR uses a gas, such as helium or carbon dioxide, to cool the fuel. LWGR uses ordinary water as both coolant and as a moderator. FBR breeds more fuel than it consumes.</p></p>
