<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Honeycomb Cores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With a Non-woven Polyester Veil</li><li>Without a Non-woven Polyester Veil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The polypropylene honeycomb cores market consists of two types: with a non-woven polyester veil and without a non-woven polyester veil. In the former type, a polyester veil is added to the outer surface of the core, providing better adhesion for bonding with other materials. This enhances the core's mechanical properties and makes it suitable for applications requiring higher strength and durability. The latter type lacks the polyester veil, making it more cost-effective and suitable for applications where lower strength requirements are acceptable. Both types offer versatility and are widely used in various industries for their lightweight and structural properties.</p></p>
