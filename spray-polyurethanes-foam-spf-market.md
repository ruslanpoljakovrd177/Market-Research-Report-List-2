<p><strong>The Spray Polyurethanes Foam (SPF) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell</li><li>Closed Cell</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF) is a type of insulation material used in the construction industry. It is categorized into three main types: open cell, closed cell, and others. Open cell SPF is lightweight and has a low R-value, making it suitable for interior applications such as walls and roofs. Closed cell SPF is denser, has a higher R-value, and acts as a moisture barrier, making it ideal for outdoor applications. The "others" category encompasses specialty SPF products, such as high-density SPF used for roofing or low-density SPF used for crafts.</p></p>
